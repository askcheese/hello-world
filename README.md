# hello-world
Just another repository -- from an idiot learning github

This is a project manager who is attempting to learn how to do more than create work breakdowns, user stories, and hoovering over people.
Like most HR & IT manangers are looking for today, I"m attempting to become an "AND" person -- one who can do this AND that AND sometimes something else.
But like a swiss army knife, I know I'm not going to be able to do all the ANDs as well as a specialist...but that won't stop me from learning and being capable.
